   <h2>Stage Two</h2>
   <p>After you have made the foundation it is time to start advertising your event. The best way to go about this is advertise on things people look at the most. Now you might think that posters in the hallways is the way to go witch is perfectly fine but the real way to go
   is to use social media. Social media is a booming thing in society that most people that you see everyday use so why not put it somewhere where 
   people can see it everyday!</p>
   <h2>Stage Three</h2> <!-- Used h3 tag here. -->
   <p>After you have the event publisised you need to think about the things you need to get in order to make the event run smoothly!

   <h2>Stage 4</h2>
   After all of the shopping is done it is time to plan a set up day. This requires getting volenteers to come in usually on the day before the event. On this day you will need to have a list of things that you would like to be 
   done during that time when people are helping. It is important that you are very organized when it comes to involving other people to make sure that everyone has a job and no one is confused.

          <p>My life is very busy, in an average day I wake up at about 7:00 A.M for school. I go to school until about three o'oclock. After school I usually go to Drama practice. Sometimes during the week I will also have voice lessons and other music inclined things. I also am involved in student council as the voce president and love every mintute of it. My life is very busy and consists a lot of me reflecting on myself and getting better. Everyone has there faults and my hope is to find mind and work hard to try to fix them as best as I can. Everyday I will try more and more to reflect a life pleasing to god and make a big point to tell myself that!</b></p>
